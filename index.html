<h1>14. Waiver and Severability</h1>
Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall
not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
The Terms of Service with the <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> Privacy Policy, (the Agreements), constitutes the entire agreement between you and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong>
and govern your use of the service, superseding any prior agreements (including,
but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).
If any provision of these Terms of Service is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of
the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.


<h1>15. Entire agreement</h1>
<p>This Agreement together with the <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> Privacy Policy, (the Agreements) constitutes all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you
    and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> and supersede any prior agreements in
    relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.
    Any additional or different terms or conditions in relation to the subject matter
    of these Agreements in any written or oral communication from you to <strong>Happy
        Penny Games</strong> are void.
    You agree and accept that you have not accepted the terms and conditions of this Agreement
    in reliance of or to any oral or written representations made by
    <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> not contained in
    this Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>16. Severability</h1>
<p>Should for any reason or to any extent any provision of this Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this
    Agreement and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>17. Mandatory arbitration; exceptions to mandatory arbitration, waiver of class action rights; limitations period; venue and choice of law</h1>
<p>i. You and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> Service or your use thereof, including our Agreement, shall be determined
    by mandatory binding arbitration. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> are each waiving the right to a trial by jury and
    the right to participate in a class or multi-party action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> subscription. The arbitration will be governed by
    the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;), as modified by this Agreement, and as administered by the AAA. ii. You and
    <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> agree that (a) any claims seeking to enforce, protect, or determine the validity or ownership of any intellectual property rights, and (b) any claims related to allegations of theft, piracy or unauthorized use
    of the <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> Service are NOT subject to mandatory arbitration. Instead, you and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> agree that the preceding claims (including but not limited to claims for injunctive or equitable
    relief) shall be exclusively decided by Courts of competent jurisdiction in Woburn, Massachusetts, and that applicable Massachusetts and/or Federal law shall govern, without regarding to choice of law principals. iii. YOU AND Happy Penny Games
    AGREE THAT
    EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS MEMBER OR IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR PROCEEDING. Further, the arbitrator shall not consolidate any other person's claims with your claims,
    and may not otherwise preside over any form of a multi-party or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable in any way, then the entirety of this arbitration section shall be null and void. The arbitrator may not
    award declaratory or injunctive relief. iv. Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act,
    omission or default giving rise to the claim; and there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period. If applicable law prohibits a one-year limitations period for asserting claims, any claim must be
    asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA's Consumer Rules with the remainder paid by <strong>Happy
        Penny Games</strong>. Any arbitration costs or fees deemed &quot;excessive&quot; will be paid by <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong>. v. You and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong> agree that this Agreement involves interstate commerce and is
    subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and <strong>Happy Penny Games</strong>further agree that applicable laws of the State of Massachusetts shall exclusively govern any dispute without regard to choice or conflicts of law rules. The sole
    and
    exclusive venue for the resolution of any dispute, whether or not subject to mandatory arbitration as described above, shall lie in Woburn, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>18. English version prevails</h1>
<p>In the event that this Agreement is translated into other languages and there is a discrepancy between the two language versions, the English language version shall prevail to the extent that such discrepancy is the result of an error in
    translation.</p>
